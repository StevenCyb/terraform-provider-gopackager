# gopackager_compile (Data Source)

Compiles GoLang source code into a binary executable. This resource requires GoLang to be installed on the system.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "gopackager_compile" "example" {
  # Path to the main source file.
  source = "main.go"
  # Compiled output destination file.
  destination = "service"
  # GOOS for compilation.
  goos = "linux"
  # GOARCH for compilation.
  goarch = "amd64"
}

# `binary_location` provides the path and file name of the compiled binary.
output "binary_location" {
  value = data.gopackager_compile.example.binary_location
}

# `binary_hash` provides the hash of the compiled binary.
# There are multiple factors that can affect the hash, that means
# false positive changes are possible.
output "binary_hash" {
  value = data.gopackager_compile.example.binary_hash
}

# Example on how to use it with AWS lambda.
resource "aws_lambda_function" "example" {
  function_name    = "example"
  runtime          = "go1.x"
  handler          = "service"
  role             = aws_iam_role.lambda_role.arn
  timeout          = 15
  filename         = data.gopackager_compile.example.binary_location
  source_code_hash = data.gopackager_compile.example.binary_hash
  memory_size      = 128
}
```
